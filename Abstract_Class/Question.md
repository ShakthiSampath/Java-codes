# **_Abstract Class_**

#### _Task_:

Given a _Book_ class and a _Solution_ class, write a _MyBook_ class
that does the following:

- _Inherits_ from _Book_

- Has a _parameterized constructor_ taking these _3 parameters_:

  - string _title_
  - string _author_
  - int _price_


- Implements the Book class' _abstract display()_ method so it prints
these 3 lines:

  - _Title_:, a space, and then the current instance's _title_.
  - _Author_:, a space, and then the current instance's _author_.
  - _Price_:, a space, and then the current instance's _price_.

#### _Note_:

Declare _MyBook_ as _public_ as other classes are being written in the same
file.
