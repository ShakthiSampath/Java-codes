# **_Dictionaries and Maps_**

#### _Task_

Given _n_ names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers. You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each _name_ queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form _name_ = _phoneNumber_; if an entry for _name_ is not found, print _Not found_ instead.

#### _NOTE :_

Your phone book should be a _Dictionary / Map / HashMap_ data structure.
