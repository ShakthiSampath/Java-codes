# **_String & Loops_**

#### _Task_

Given a string, _S_, of length _N_ that is indexed from _0_ to _N-1_ , print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as _2_ space-separated strings on a single line.

The _first_ input should display the number of strings and then the string that would be converted to separate strings.
